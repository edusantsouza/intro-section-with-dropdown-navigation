## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript for DOM manipulation


### What I learned

Hi, dev! Nice to see you here. This challenge was great to exercise concepts like:

-  CSS Grid 
-  Flexbox
-  Animations
-  Media queries
-  DOM Manipulation
  
 Positioning elements on the page is much easier when you use the right approach. Even why we need to worry about the differents screen sizes and the mobile-first concept. So I did my best to offer a good experience when the page is resize. Its important to keep improving and learning to each project, and that's what I have been doing till here. Hope you enjoy it and maybe see something usefull to apply in your own projects.


### Continued development

Further up I hope being better on positioning elements with CSS, focused on mobile-first workflow to bring up a good usability on differents screens sizes. Moreover, I'm still learning Semantic HTML and considering my current HTML structure too simple to what page demands.


### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Guide](https://www.treinaweb.com.br/blog/css-grid-um-guia-interativo-parte-1-containers) - It's always very handy to remember how to apply some behaviours in your grid.
- [Google Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons) - I needed to use some icons on the page and find very cliver the way we can use Google Material Symbols to add icons on the HTML in a easy way. Really recommend it.
